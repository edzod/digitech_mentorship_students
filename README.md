# Digitech – Base44 Prototype Project

This repository documents the prototype and final pitch developed in the **Digitech national entrepreneurship program**, using the **Base44 platform**.  
Unlike a pure mentorship role, I was actively involved in **building the prototype and shaping the pitch** together with the students.

## My Role
- Worked hands-on with the team to **design and implement parts of the Base44 prototype**.
- Explained how to structure work in Base44 (blocks, methods, comparing approaches).
- Co-created the **presentation content**: what to highlight, how to explain the solution, and what was missing.
- Trained the team on **pitching and public speaking**.
- Brought inspiration and ideas to sharpen their value proposition.

## Deliverables
- **Presentation (Canva link):** [View online](https://www.canva.com/…)
- **Slides (images):** see `/assets/slides/`
- **Photos from event:** see `/assets/event_photos/`
- **Prototype demo:** video is available through the Canva link

## Final Pitch
- 3-minute pitch + 1-minute demo of the Base44 prototype.
- Presented to a judging panel including **Microsoft** and **StarPlan**.
- Included live Q&A with the judges.

✨ This project highlights my ability to **mentor and also co-create**, blending teaching, guidance, and hands-on development in a real innovation program.
