# Digitech ‚Äì Base44 Prototype Project  

This repository documents the **NextMove prototype and pitch**, developed in the **Digitech national entrepreneurship program** using the **Base44 platform**.  
Our team advanced through an initial **screening**, into the **semi-finals**, and finally reached the **grand final (Top 7 nationwide)**.  

Unlike a pure mentorship role, I was **actively co-creating**: working side-by-side with the students on the prototype, the pitch design, and the delivery.

## My Role  
- Worked hands-on with the team to **design and implement parts of the Base44 prototype**.  
- Guided the team on **how to structure their work in Base44** (blocks, methods, comparing approaches).  
- **Co-created the presentation** ‚Äì defining the story, highlighting the key insights, and improving weak points.  
- Trained the students on **pitching and public speaking** (using tools like [Yoodli](https://yoodli.ai/) for real-time feedback).  
- Drew inspiration from **GenAI and innovation conferences** I attend, bringing fresh methods into their pitch (e.g., *‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù* ‚Äì mixing creativity, teamwork, and storytelling with technology).  
- Helped the team **think beyond coding**: how to frame their idea, test assumptions, and position it as an entrepreneurial solution.

## The NextMove Prototype  
The product aimed to address **real-world challenges** faced by young job seekers:  
- üü£ Lack of guidance in career path selection.  
- üü§ Poor matching between candidates and jobs.  
- üîµ Information overload that makes decision-making difficult.  

The prototype included:  
- **Personalized job-matching system** based on skills, preferences, and aspirations.  
- A **user-friendly interface** designed in Base44.  
- Pitch materials (slides, demo, and 3-min presentation).

‚ú® This project showcases my ability to **mentor, co-create, and inspire** ‚Äì combining **AI/tech knowledge, communication skills, and entrepreneurial mindset** to help students build something impactful.  
It also reflects my approach of **‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù** ‚Äì not just lines of code, but blending **creativity, teamwork, and real-world impact** into the process.
