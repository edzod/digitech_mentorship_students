# Digitech – Base44 Prototype Project

This repository documents the prototype and final pitch developed in the **Digitech national entrepreneurship program**, using the **Base44 platform**.  
Unlike a pure mentorship role, I was **actively co-creating**: working side-by-side with the students on the prototype itself, the pitch design, and the delivery.

## My Role
- Worked hands-on with the team to **design and implement parts of the Base44 prototype**.  
- Explained how to structure work in Base44 (blocks, methods, comparing approaches).  
- **Co-created the presentation** – deciding what to highlight, what was missing, and how to tell the story.  
- Trained the team on **pitching and public speaking**, including practice runs.  
- Introduced external tools like [**Yoodli**](https://yoodli.ai/) to help the students rehearse and improve their public speaking.  
- Brought inspiration and techniques from **GenAI conferences and innovation events** I attended, to connect their project to the latest trends and real-world vibes.  
- Helped the team **think like entrepreneurs**, not just coders – balancing prototype building with storytelling and impact.  

## Deliverables
- **Presentation (Canva link):** [View online](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGgSj-j6b4/IUtJpiL0DN8z9Rl7BbHbig/edit)  
- **Slides (images):** see `/assets/slides/`  
- **Photos from the event:** see `/assets/event_photos/`  
- **Prototype demo:** video accessible via the Canva link  

## Final Pitch
- **3-minute pitch** + **1-minute demo** of the Base44 prototype.  
- Presented live in front of **Microsoft** and **StarPlan** judges.  
- Included a **Q&A session** where the students confidently answered tough questions.

✨ This project highlights my ability to **mentor, co-create, and inspire**: combining teaching, guidance, and active building.  
It shows my approach of **"vibe coding"** – not just lines of code, but blending **creativity, teamwork, communication, and real-world impact** into the process.
